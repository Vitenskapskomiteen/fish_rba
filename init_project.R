# Setting up the folder structure:

# @Josef; you can add your own paths here, e.g.
# home = c('josteins home path','josefs homepath'), and we could, when
# running the code locally, just ## out the ones we don't use?

# See here for the idea behind this structure, not sure if it's exactly
# what we need, but lets try.
